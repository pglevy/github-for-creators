# GitHub for Creators

**How to use GitHub’s free suite of tools to create content, manage projects, and share knowledge**

GitHub is primarily made by developers for developers. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be used by creators of all types. With a free account, you can do things like publish blogs, host websites, curate wikis, track project work, host discussions, and much more. GitHub can be your homebase for all kinds of projects. All you need is a little of bit of know-how, which I’ve compiled in this ebook.
